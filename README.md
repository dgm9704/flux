## ESMA XML report validation using XSLT

- Main focus are ESMA AIFMD XML reports, but the same structure should be viable for other formats in the future also (CSDR, MMF etc)
- The goal is to implement all ESMA CAM/CAF validation rules.
- These are mostly conditional existence checks based on the existence or value of another element.
- The actual "product" is the *.xslt files, anything else is just for testing or documentation
- Validations should be trivial to run with any XSLT processor
- The output is very rudimentary for now. After all the rules are implemented, the output can be polished.
- XSLT (and XPATH, XQUERY) version used is 1.0, as this provides best tooling support. Some functionality will be missing because of this.
- Check digit calculations are not implemented, but have been replaced with lookups instead.

## Specifications
   For some reason ESMA does not provide the specifications for AIFMD validations publicly, and neither does FIN-FSA.
   ESMA provides [technical rules for the fields](https://www.esma.europa.eu/document/aifmd-reporting-it-technical-guidance-rev-4-updated)
   I have found some versions of the AIFMD validation specifications from other sources:

## My environment
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for development
   - [xsltproc](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc.html) for stylesheet processing
   - [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html) for schema validation

## Usage
1) Always validate your XML against the schema first.

If this gives errors, stop and correct them.
``` 
xmllint aifm.xml --schema schema/aifmd.xsd --noout
``` 
or
``` 
xmllint aif.xml --schema schema/aifmd.xsd --noout
``` 

2) Run the transformation:

``` 
xsltproc aifmd.xslt aifm.xml
``` 
or
``` 
xsltproc aifmd.xslt aif.xml
``` 

Sample output for aif validation errors:

111111#001 AIFNationalCode of the offending fund
```
  <error>
    <record>111111#001</record>
    <code>CAF-146</code>
    <message>The reported value is not consistent with the rank.</message>
    <context>
      <field>
        <name>Ranking</name>
        <value>2</value>
      </field>
      <field>
        <name>LeverageAmount</name>
        <value>222222</value>
      </field>
    </context>
  </error>

```

## Status
-  AIFMD validations have been implemented!

	Exceptions: 
    - FIL-009 is a filename check
    - CAM-001, CAF-001, CAF-005 only make sense when done by ESMA


- Checkdigit calculations are implemented with ESXLT extensions available with xsltproc

- Output now includes all values relevant to the validation that are available at execution time

- OK to file bugs!

- have started on CSDR9 validations
	- roughly 1/3? are implemented in some way
	- output is very minimal

## Next steps 
- Add richer info about the error location and related values from specifications
- Add more info about the validation to the error (perhaps controllable via argument)
- If possible, find out the output format that ESMA uses!
- There are some warnings also (WAF-*) - do they go into a "warning" element, or should there be a severity value?
- Implement CSDR9 validations?
- Implement CSDR7 validations?
- Implement MMF validations?
- Implement ESEF validations?


## How you can help
- testing and filing issues against specific validations
- providing up-to-date specifications
- providing test reports 
- **Do not send me anything that is confidential or that can't be shared publicly**
